I am a member of rust-lang-jp, a community for Rust programming
language especially for Japanese speakers. I am wondering if our
community is eligible for free premium plan described below:

https://zulipchat.com/plans/
> Do you have special plans for open source projects, non-profits,
> groups of friends, and other non-commercial entities?
>
> Yes! Zulip Cloud Premium is free for open source projects and a wide
> variety of non-commercial entities. We also often offer steep
> discounts to educational institutions, and in other scenarios where
> users are not being paid a salary. Just contact sales@zulipchat.com
> and we’d be happy to discuss your situation!

Let me explain a bit about our community:

- It is a place for Rust users who speak Japanese to share news/ideas
  and help each other
- Anybody who is interested in Rust can join
- There is no membership fee to be paid
- Japanese is the primary spoken language, but English (and other
  languages) are allowed to help non-fluent Japanese speakers to
  communicate
- We volunteer to translate official/unofficial English Rust documents
  into Japanese. We have a GitHub organization for translation work:
  https://github.com/rust-lang-ja/ (and you will see I (tatsuya6502)
  am a member)
- Some members are actively developing open source products written in
  Rust
- Currently we are using Slack free plan, but we are looking for an
  alternative service mainly because:
  * Message search is limited to recent 10K messages
  * Poor message thread (topic) support
- There are about 550 members in the Slack team, and about 100 of them
  are active
